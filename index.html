    <p> <strong>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." We have so many things that we have to 
    do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!</strong> </p>

    <p>I am the stone that builder refused<br> 
    I am the visual<br>
    The inspiration<br>
    That made lady sing the blues<br>
    I'm the spark that makes your idea bright<br>
    The same spark<br>
    That lights the dark<br>
    So that you can know your left from your right
    I am the ballot in your box<br>
    The bullet in your gun<br>
    The inner glow that lets you know<br>
    To call your brother son<br>
    The story that just begun<br>
    The promise of what's to come<br>
    And I'm 'a remain a soldier till the war is won</p>
